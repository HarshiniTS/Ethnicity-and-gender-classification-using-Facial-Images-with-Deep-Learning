# Ethnicity-and-gender-classification-using-Facial-Images-with-Deep-Learning
Ethnicity is a key demographic characteristic of people, and it plays an important role in fully 
automated facial recognition. It also has a wide range of real-world applications, including 
Human-Computer Interaction, demographic-based classification, biometric-based recognition, 
security, and defense, to mention a few.
Human faces provide a variety of knowledge on soft biometric characteristics including age, ethnicity, and gender. 
These characteristics may be extremely valuable for facial recognition, video surveillance re-identification. 
Ethnicity, as a characteristic of humans, plays a fundamental and critical role in biometric recognition. 
We describe a unique method for extracting ethnicity from face photos in this research.
Humans can categorize a face in a variety of ways based on its identity, as well as a number of 
other demographic traits such as ethnicity, gender, and age. In the biological, psychological, 
and cognitive sciences, much research has gone into figuring out how the human brain sees, 
represents, and remembers faces during the last few decades. To obtain some insight into this 
challenge, computational models have also been built. 
The human face and facial 
characteristics have recently gotten a lot of attention from researchers in the field of computer vision, and are regarded as one of the most popular areas.

In this research, we propose a model where we use the UTKFace dataset. The UTKFace dataset 
is a large-scale face dataset that spans a wide age range from 0 to 116 years. The collection 
contains approximately 20,000 face images with age, gender, and ethnicity labels. The images 
show a wide range of poses, facial expressions, lighting, occlusion, and resolution. Face 
identification, age estimation, age progress monitoring, landmark localization, and other tasks 
might be performed with this dataset.
Many computer vision tasks, such as image categorization, object identification, and face 
recognition, have recently shown breakthrough success because of deep learning approaches. 
This encourages us to use deep learning approaches to address the challenge of large-scale face 
ethnicity, age, and gender classification, notably using deep convolutional neural networks 
(DCNN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). 

In this research, we propose a novel 
approach using custom CNN models and some transfer learning models like VGG-16, Xception, Resnet50, MobileNet, EfficientNet to classify the multilabel and multiclass facial images.
